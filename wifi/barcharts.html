<p id="title">HOURLY AVERAGE TIME SPENT IN APPS</p>
<p id="name">Chengliang Li</p>
<p id="text">
<!-- I have collected data for 10 days from Screen Time, which records the time I spend on different
apps every hour in each day, in Settings<br> of my iPhone, and I calculated the average minutes
I spent in my top 4 popular apps in every hour of the whole day. It’s easy to tell my<br>daily
schedule (e.g. I usually slept from 3:00 – 10:00 during these 10 days) from all of three different
ways of visualizations, and also <br>each of them has different advantages: From the scatter
plot it’s evident to compare the different time spent per hour in each app; from<br> the bar chart
the total minutes that I was using apps per hour are clear to contrast, as well as the Sankey
diagram, from which the total <br>minutes spent in an app in the whole day is also obvious.

From the visualizations it’s obvious that although the composition of percentage <br>of each
hour is different, I spent the most time in WeChat
(the main instant messaging app I use) almost in every hour, except for 19:00 – <br>20:00,in which I spent much more time in Alipay
than
other apps (I play a game in Alipay and from 19:00 to 19:30 there is the highest<br> chance
to get scores), even though the total time for Alipay in a day is the least.
<br><br>
If you hover your mouse cursor over a dot, bar, node or link of these interactive charts, you will see a pop-up label showing how many
<br> minutes I spent in an app or during a certain amount of time. Furthermore, you can drag the nodes in sankey diagram vertically to
<br>make them in whatever order you want. -->
